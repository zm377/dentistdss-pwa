## Configuration

## Backend-Only OpenAI Integration

The system uses a backend-only OpenAI integration architecture through Spring AI:

### Architecture
- **Spring AI Backend**: All OpenAI API communication handled by the backend
- **Enhanced SSE Processing**: Frontend uses OpenAI SDK utilities for better data processing
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces using OpenAI SDK types
- **No Frontend API Keys**: No OpenAI API keys required in the frontend environment
- **Secure Communication**: All AI interactions flow through authenticated backend endpoints

### Features
- **Enhanced SSE Streaming**: Improved Server-Sent Events processing with OpenAI SDK utilities
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error detection and user-friendly messaging
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support using OpenAI SDK type definitions
- **Session Management**: Backend-managed conversation sessions with JWT authentication
- **Intelligent Token Spacing**: Smart token concatenation for natural text flow

### Usage
The chatbot API interface remains unchanged:
```typescript
// Help chat (no authentication required)
const response = await api.chatbot.help("What are your clinic hours?", onStreamCallback);

// AI Dentist (requires authentication)
const clinicalResponse = await api.chatbot.aidentist("Patient symptoms...", onStreamCallback);
```

All OpenAI communication flows through the Spring AI backend at `/api/genai/chatbot/*` endpoints.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
